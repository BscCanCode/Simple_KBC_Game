## ðŸ“Œ About This Project
A basic 5-question quiz inspired by Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC), built with Python. Created on 10 April 2025 as a beginner exercise to explore functions, user input, and simple logic. Itâ€™s rough but reflects my early coding adventure.

## Why I Built This
- To practice creating a function and handling user input.
- To simulate a quiz format with incremental rewards.
- To learn conditional statements and basic flow control.

## ðŸš€ What It Does
- Presents 5 questions with 4 options each, awarding cash for correct answers:
  - Q1: Largest country? (1=Russia, Rs.10,000)
  - Q2: Indiaâ€™s PM? (1=Narendra Modi, Rs.20,000)
  - Q3: Indiaâ€™s capital? (2=New Delhi, Rs.30,000)
  - Q4: Largest continent? (4=Asia, Rs.40,000)
  - Q5: Auto-rickshaw wheels in Mumbai? (3=Three_Wheels, Rs.50,000)
- Offers Rs.150,000 for all correct answers (theoretical, due to current limits).
- Ends with Rs.0 for invalid inputs or wrong answers, showing total winnings.

---

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Defining and calling a simple function (`fun()`).
- Using `try-except` to handle non-integer inputs.
- Applying `if` statements for answer checking.
- Managing output with print statements and separators.

---

## Known Issues.
- Repetitive code for each questionâ€”needs a data structure (e.g., list).

## Author
- [Sid.py] ([https://github.com/BscCanCode](https://github.com/BscCanCode))

## Development Notes
- Uses basic Python (functions, conditionals, try-except).
- Requires no special librariesâ€”pure vanilla code.

---

## NOTE
- README crafted with AI chatbot assistance.
- Kept raw to document my learning processâ€”plan to refine it later.
